# hacked

Hacked is a Discord bot that uses the [mamba](https://github.com/Gelbpunkt/mamba-lang) Python-like language. It aims to teach users how to code, right in their (we hope) favorite chat. Challenges are given and sent within Discord. If you need any help, a [support server](https://discord.gg/UeeSvat) has been set up.
